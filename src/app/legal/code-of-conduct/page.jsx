				<ul className={'bulleted'}>

				<h3>{'Social Rules'}</h3>

				<p>{'An important part of removing obstacles to a great community is having a small set of social rules. These are originally forked from '}<Link href={'https://www.recurse.com/'}>{'The Recurse Center\'s'}</Link>{' manual:'}</p>

				<ul className={'bulleted'}>
					<li>{'No feigning surprise.'}</li>
					<li>{'No well-actually\'s.'}</li>

				<p>{'Subtle -isms are small things that make others feel uncomfortable, things that we all sometimes do by mistake. For example, saying '}<em>{'"It\'s so easy my grandmother could do it"'}</em>{' is a subtle -ism. Like the other three social rules, this one is often accidentally broken. Like the other three, it\'s not a big deal to mess up â€” you just apologize and move on.'}</p>

You do '}<em>{'not'}</em>{' need to be the target of harassment to speak up. Making this the best possible community is everyone\'s responsibility.'}</p>

				<p>{'We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we\'ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of my communities or the general public. I will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.'}</p>

				<h4>{'Consequences'}</h4>

				<p>{'Users asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.'}</p>

				<p>{'If a user engages in harassing behavior, the moderators may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all facets of my community and identification of the user as a harasser to members of my community and/or the general public.'}</p>
